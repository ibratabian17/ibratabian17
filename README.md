## 👨‍💻 About Me

The core of everything I do is simple: **curiosity and the open-source spirit.** I love taking software apart (`Reverse Engineering`) to understand how it works. From there, I try to create replicas or even build **free alternatives to paid software**. For me, technology should be accessible to everyone.

I used to be one of the maintainers for **xdroidOSS** on the legendary Poco F1 device. Unfortunately, the project was discontinued about two years ago, and I personally hit a wall with server rental costs to continue building ROMs independently. Maybe someday, if fortune allows, this Poco F1 will build ROMs again!

Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of **AI & Machine Learning**. I'm trying to understand how it works and dream of creating useful, intelligent tools. Of course, there are challenges...

### 💻 My Battle Station

All the projects here are done on a very humble setup. It's proof that passion matters more than specs!
- **Main Device:** Xiaomi Poco F1 (The Legend!)
- **Tinkering Partner:** iPhone 13 (yeah, it's on the backburner)
- **Powered by a Potato PC:** CPU AMD FX-6100 | GPU Nvidia GT 620 | RAM 4GB
  - *(Endless thanks to Google Colab for being there during the struggle of training AI models 🙏)*

My dream is simple: to one day upgrade my "battle station" so I can turn more crazy ideas into real projects without worrying about limitations.

### 🌐 Frontend (Web)
> Honestly, I'm not that great with modern web frameworks. So my go-to is **Vanilla JavaScript + CSS**. Sounds weird? Absolutely. While others struggle with plain CSS, it's pretty much all I can do.
